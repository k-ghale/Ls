# LifeSync
#### Build and Track Habits Together

## Overview

**LifeSync** is a collaborative platform designed for **group habit and task management**. This document serves as the primary **System Design Document (SDD)**, outlining the core architecture, user requirements (User Stories), and data models for the application. The system supports distinct roles—**Owner**, **Moderator**, **Member**, and **Viewer**—to facilitate structured collaboration and robust progress tracking.

## 🏗️ System Architecture and Data Models

This section provides the visual blueprints and underlying data structures guiding the system's development and implementation.

### System Architecture Design

The system architecture is the foundational blueprint defining the application's structure and the interaction between its components.

### Data Models

#### 📊 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The ERD visualizes the relationships between the main data entities in the system, defining the structure of the database and ensuring data integrity.

#### 🧩 Class Diagram

The Class Diagram illustrates the primary classes, their attributes, operations, and the static relationships between them, essential for object-oriented design and defining application logic.
